    We review recent progress in the global determination of the collinear parton distributions (PDFs) of the proton within the NNPDF framework.
    This progress includes NNPDF4.0 variants with QED effects and with missing higher order uncertainties (MHOUs) via the theory covariance matrix formalism,
    as well as PDFs based on QCD calculations at approximate N\(^3\)LO (aN\(^3\)LO) accuracy. We present the combination of these theoretical developments resulting into
    NNPDF4.0 aN\(^3\)LO variants accounting for QED corrections and with a photon PDF. We compare these aN\(^3\)LO QED PDFs with analogous results obtained by the MSHT group,
    and briefly quantify their implications at the level of representative LHC cross-sections.

    We extend the existing leading (LO), next-to-leading (NLO), and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) NNPDF4.0 sets of parton
    distribution functions (PDFs) to approximate next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (aN\(^3\)LO). We construct an approximation to
    the N\(^3\)LO splitting functions that includes all available partial information from both fixed-order computations and from small and
    large \(x\) resummation, and estimate the uncertainty on this approximation by varying the set of basis functions used to construct the
    approximation. We include known N\(^3\)LO corrections to deep-inelastic scattering structure functions and extend the FONLL general-mass
    scheme to \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)\) accuracy. We determine a set of aN\(^3\)LO PDFs by accounting both for the uncertainty on
    splitting functions due to the incomplete knowledge of N\(^3\)LO terms, and to the uncertainty related to missing higher corrections (MHOU),
    estimated by scale variation, through a theory covariance matrix formalism. We assess the perturbative stability of the resulting PDFs,
    we study the impact of MHOUs on them, and we compare our results to the aN\(^3\)LO PDFs from the MSHT group. We examine the phenomenological
    impact of aN\(^3\)LO corrections on parton luminosities at the LHC, and give a first assessment of the impact of aN\(^3\)LO PDFs on the Higgs
    and Drell-Yan total production cross-sections. We find that the aN\(^3\)LO NNPDF4.0 PDFs are consistent within uncertainties with their NNLO
    counterparts, that they improve the description of the global dataset and the perturbative convergence of Higgs and Drell-Yan cross-sections,
    and that MHOUs on PDFs decrease substantially with the increase of perturbative order.

    We include uncertainties due to missing higher order corrections to QCD computations (MHOU) used in the determination of parton
    distributions (PDFs) in the recent NNPDF4.0 set of PDFs. We use our previously published methodology, based on the treatment of MHOUs
    and their full correlations through a theory covariance matrix determined by scale variation, now fully incorporated in the new NNPDF
    theory pipeline. We assess the impact of the inclusion of MHOUs on the NNPDF4.0 central values and uncertainties, and specifically show
    that they lead to improved consistency of the PDF determination with an ensuing moderate reduction of PDF uncertainties at NNLO.

    We construct a set of parton distribution functions (PDFs), based on the recent NNPDF4.0 PDF set, that also include a photon PDF. The
    photon PDF is constructed using the LuxQED formalism, while QED evolution accounting for \(\mathcal{O} (\alpha)\),
    \(\mathcal{O} (\alpha \alpha_s)\), and \(\mathcal{O} (\alpha^2)\) corrections is implemented and benchmarked by means of the
    \(\texttt{EKO}\) code. We investigate the impact of QED effects on NNPDF4.0, and compare our results both to our previous NNPDF3.1QED PDF
    set and to other recent PDF sets that include the photon. We assess the impact of photon-initiated processes and electroweak corrections
    on a variety of representative LHC processes, and find that they can reach the 5% level in vector boson pair production at large
    invariant mass.

  abstract: >
    The need of percent precision in high energy physics requires the inclusion of QED effects in theoretical predictions, including the
    contribution of photon-initiated processes. In this contribution we present ongoing work towards extending the NNPDF4.0 NNLO
    determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) with QED effects and a photon PDF. We study the impact of QED effects in the
    NNPDF4.0 fit, compare our results with NNPDF3.1QED and other recent QED PDF fits, and we assess the impact of the photon PDF for
    representative LHC processes.

    We present a more reliable approach to approximate the unknown next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N\(^3\)LO) transverse momentum
    distribution of colourless final states, namely the Higgs boson produced via gluon fusion and the lepton pair produced via Drell--Yan
    (DY) mechanism. The approximation we construct relies on the combination of various resummation formalisms -- namely threshold, small-pt
    and high energy resummations -- by exploiting the singularity structure of the large logarithms in Mellin space. We show that for the
    case of Higgs boson production, the approximate N3LO transverse momentum distribution amounts to a correction of a few percent with
    respect to the NNLO result with a reduction in the scale dependence.

  title: "Construction of a next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order approximation for heavy flavour production in deep inelastic scattering with quark masses"
  type: MasterThesis
  venue: "Master Thesis"
  year: 2021
  authors:
    - laurenti
  abstract: >
    The subject of this thesis is the construction of an approximation for the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N\(^3\)LO) deep
    inelastic scattering (DIS) massive coefficient function of the gluon for \(F_2\) in heavy quark pair production. Indeed, this object is one
    of the ingredients needed for the construction of any variable flavour number (factorization) scheme at \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)\). The construction of
    such scheme is crucial for the improvement of the accuracy of the extraction of the parton distribution functions from the experimental
    data, that in turn will provide an improvement of the accuracy of all the theoretical predictions in high energy physics. Despite the
    function we are interested in is not known exactly, its expansion in some kinematic limits is available. In particular the high-scale
    limit (\(Q^2 \gg m^2\)), high-energy limit (\(z\rightarrow 0\), where \(z\) is the argument of the coefficient function) and threshold limit
    (\(z\rightarrow z_{max} = 1/(1+4m^2/Q^2)\)) of the exact coefficient function are all known, with the exception of some terms that we will provide in
    approximate form. Therefore, combining these limits in a proper way, we will construct an approximation for the unknown term of the N\(^3\)LO
    gluon coefficient function, that describes the exact curve in the whole range of \(z\). Since other approximations for the N\(^3\)LO gluon
    coefficient functions are present in the literature, we will conclude by comparing our final approximate coefficient functions with such
    approximations. We will show a comparison both for the NNLO, whose exact function is known, and for the N\(^3\)LO. With our approach, we
    expect our results to be more accurate than previous approximations, thus providing a sufficient precision for a complete description of
    DIS at N\(^3\)LO and the consequent determination of N\(^3\)LO PDFs.
