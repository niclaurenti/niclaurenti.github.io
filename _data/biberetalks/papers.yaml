  abstract: >
    The need of percent precision in high energy physics requires the inclusion of QED effects in theoretical predictions, for example like the contributions coming from photon initiated processes. It is trivial then, to correctly determine the photon content of the proton.
    In this work, we extend the NNPDF4.0 NNLO determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) with a photon PDF, determined within the LuxQED formalism, which evolves with the gluon and quark PDFs via DGLAP equations that contain NLO QED corrections.
    We study the impact of the QED effects to the NNPDF4.0 methodology, we compare our results with NNPDF3.1QED and other recent QED PDF fits and we asses the impact of the photon PDF for photon-initiated processes for LHC processes.

  abstract: >
    Quantum Chromodynamics describes the proton as a bound state of quarks and gluons. However, it is un- clear whether the heavy quarks,
    i.e. quarks whose mass is larger than the proton mass, take part to the non perturbative dynamics of the proton. They are the so-called
    intrinsic heavy quarks. It has been discussed for a long time that the charm quark, that is the lightest heavy quark and its mass sits
    slightly above the proton mass, could have a non negligible intrinsic component. However, so far all the efforts to establish the
    presence of an intrinsic charm remained inconclusive. Here, disentangling the non perturbative component from charm-anticharm pairs
    arising from high-energy radiation, we provide evidence of intrinsic charm in the proton by exploiting a high-precision determination of
    the quark-gluon content of the proton based on machine learning and a large experimental dataset. We confirm these findings by comparing
    to very recent data on Z-boson production with charm jets from the LHCb experiment.
