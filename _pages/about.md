I am a Ph.D. student in particle physics at the University of Milan.
With a background in theoretical physics in the field of particle physics, my research focuses in the high precision study of the internal
structure of the proton using machine learning tool, like neural networks, using experimental data collected at particle accelerators
like HERA or LHC.
This results in the extraction of the so-called parton disrtibution functions (PDFs), i.e. functions that describe the proton in terms of
the distribution of its constituents (quarks and gluons).
This is fundamental for the physics program of all the particle accelerators in high energy physics, like the LHC at CERN, since the PDFs
enter in the computation of all theory predictions in the hadron accelerators.

I am also a computer science enthusiast: during my research carreer I worked with a variety of programming languages, but in particular
with C++ and Python.
I have hands-on experience with various machine learning tools, like Keras and Tensorflow.
