I am a Ph.D. student in particle physics at the University of Milan and a member of the [NNPDF](https://nnpdf.mi.infn.it) collaboration
where I work as a code developer. Check here the [NNPDF Github page](https://github.com/NNPDF).

With a background in theoretical physics in the field of particle physics, my research focuses in the high precision study of the internal
structure of the proton using machine learning tool, like neural networks, using experimental data collected at particle accelerators
like HERA or LHC.
This results in the extraction of the so-called parton disrtibution functions (PDFs), i.e. functions that describe the proton in terms of
the distribution of its constituents (quarks and gluons).
This is fundamental for the physics program of all the particle accelerators in high energy physics, like the LHC at CERN, since the PDFs
enter in the computation of all theory predictions in the hadron accelerators.

The two follwing pictures show (on the left) the neural network used in the analysis and (on the right) the set of datapoints used.
The data comes from a variety of independent experiments like [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern), [CMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms),
 [LHCb](https://home.cern/science/experiments/lhcb), [HERA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HERA_(particle_accelerator)),
 [SLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLAC_National_Accelerator_Laboratory) and others.
Both pictures are taken from the [NNPDF4.0 paper](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1918284).

I am also a computer science enthusiast: during my research carreer I worked with a variety of programming languages, but in particular
with C++ and Python.
I have hands-on experience with various machine learning tools, like Keras and Tensorflow.

My Research Projects
--------------------

The main research projects that I worked on during my research career are the following:

### Including Electrodynamics effects in PDFs determination

Usually, the PDFs determinantion is carried out considering only the effects coming from the strong interaction, i.e. the so-called
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), since it is the dominant effect.

However, if one wants to achieve a precision of the order of percent in the theory predictions, then the effects coming
from the elecrtomagnetic interaction, i.e. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), cannot be neglected.
It follows that the proton's components aquire a new member: the photon!
The photon PDF is somehow special: while the other PDFs cannot be computed but must be extracted from data, the photon can be
computed with an approch called LuxQED method, see [arXiv:1607.04266](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1475703) and [arXiv:1708.01256](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1614486), with an equation that links it to the electron-proton scattering predictions.

The following picture, taken from the [NNPDF4.0 paper](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2747770) shows the comparison of the photon PDFs from the most recent analysis
