{% include base_path %}

I started playing basketball in 2003 when I was 6 years old, for the newborn society [Minibasket Roma Team-up](http://www.minibasketromateamup.it){: .btn--research}.
At the beginning of the 2009/2010 season I passed to Sam Basket Roma and at the end of an amazing season we unfortunately
lost in the final for the title of champions of the region Lazio.
I still have nightmares for it.

In the following years I kept playing for Sam Basket Roma in all the youth sectors.
In 2016 I was passed to the first team that played in the Italian C Silver series.

In the following years, due to University commitments, I quit my basketball career to play at amateur level.

In the end, with the start of the COVID19 pandemic in 2020, I completely stopped my basketball (and competitive sport)
activities.

Personal bests
--------------

- Most points: 41
- Most assists: Passing the ball was not an option
- Most rebounds: a lot
- Most blocks: didn't count them since they were too many
- Most steals: playing defence is boring
